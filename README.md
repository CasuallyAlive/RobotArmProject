# RobotArmProject
Robot arm that I designed and built in a week during my sophomore year. Code was ran on an arduino nano V3 board. Parts were soldered onto a prototyping pcb board, the arm itself was built on a frame of "cost-effective" popsicle sticks.

# Future Plans for Project
3D print the body of the arm and implement inverse kinematics, perhaps add a camera for computer vision.
